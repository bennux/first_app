# Ruby on Rail Tutoral: first application

this is the first application for [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by 
Example*](http://railstutorial.org/)

	1) fixed the "No route matches [GET] "/" error by changing/adding a line in the "routes.rb":

        #root :to => "benny#hello"

	2) changed the content of the defined variables in benny_data.rb from strings ("benny", "federal way") 
	   to the actual variables and passing them using "attr_accessor"
